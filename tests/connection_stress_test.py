"""
Benchmark script for testing performance and data integrity through a tunnel.
It spawns a TCP listener (which portredirect's client side will connect to)
and concurrently launches several workers that connect to a separate TCP port
(portredirect's server side). Once a connection is established (via PR tunnel),
both sides run a bidirectional data transfer test that sends pseudorandom blocks
with a CRC32 checksum appended.

The block protocol is defined as follows:
    - For each block, a header (8 bytes) is sent:
         • 4 bytes: current block length (unsigned int, network byte order)
         • 4 bytes: CRC32 checksum computed on the block data
    - Then the block data (of the indicated length) is sent.
The receiver reads the header, then the data block, computes the checksum on the fly,
and compares it with the transmitted value. This avoids having to store a copy of
the expected data for later verification.
